README

The files included are based on the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" compiled by the University of California Irvine's Machine Learning Repository (herein referred to as the UCI data). Specifically, two data sets are included:

1. A subset of the UCI data consisting of just the mean and standard deviations
2. Determining the mean of UCI data based on the activities the subject was conducting as well as the specific subject.

Both datasets are included in the enclosed file, run_analysis.R. For instructions on interpreting the R file and the meaning of the variables included in the file, please see the enclosed codebook.
